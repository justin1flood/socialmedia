    <h2>Cautions and Warnings</h2>
    <p>When using any social media app in general, there will always be an issue with safety. Using them with
caution can minimize the risk but you will never truly be safe when using them as information gets leaked
all the time. The best practice is to only put up and share information that you feel comfortable with
everyone knowing.
With Instagram in general, there are many ways that you can stay protected. One of the easiest ways is to
put your account on private. This will restrict access to your account, meaning no one can view your posts
unless they follow you. People can request to follow you but is it your decision whether you want them to be
able to view your account. You also have the option to choose who can comment on your posts. Your
        Instagram Stories are also private.</p>

<p>However, if your account is set on private, your profile is still public so they can see your profile photo, bio
and username. This shouldn’t be an issue as long as you don’t have any information you’re not comfortable
sharing with everyone.
When posting pictures on Instagram, you should keep in mind the location setting and the tags you use.
These could easily show your location to people. Tags can also be used to see your interests and your
location so use them with caution.
You should also be careful when sharing beyond Instagram. If you have any other accounts on other sites
like Facebook and they aren’t private, it could be shared to everyone.
People can also get to your account if you like other people’s post and if you’re tagged in their posts or
stories. You can un-tag your account from posts but you can’t from stories so you can ask the person to
remove you from the story. Stories aren’t permanent so after 24 hours they get removed.
If someone is harassing you, you can always block them and report them to Instagram. Try your best to
ignore them and don’t post anything to aggravate them. You can also report people if they’re impersonating
you or if they are a spam account.
If you take these cautions into consideration,
you can minimize the risk that comes with Instagram or any social media.</p>

    <h2>Teaching and Learning</h2>
    <p>Teaching and learning can be improved by using social media in education nowadays. Social media and
technology has become a huge part of our daily lives with the majority of adults and teenagers with at least
one or two different social media tools or apps which can be accessed from many devices. Since we all still
use these apps, there are definitely ways to implement them into education. Some ways benefits and
        approaches to using social media in education are:</p>
<p>1. Communication
This one of the biggest advantages to social media, it gives great access to communicate to anyone
around the world. Students can connect with their fellow students and teachers easily and from a
    wide range of devices from mobile phones to PC’s.</p>
<p>2. Collaboration
Students and teachers can collaborate easily through tools and apps such as Google Drive and
    Google Docs, making it easy to access files and documents that the whole class needs.</p>
<p>3. Finding information and inspiration
Students can use social media to find information and be up to date to current events through apps
such as Twitter. They can find inspiration for projects through sites and apps like Tumblr and
    Pinterest.</p>

<p>4. Parents Involvement
Social Media in Education also helps parents to be connected and involved in the students learning.
If the school has a Twitter or Facebook page, parents and students can follow to be updated on the
    latest news, projects and achievements.</p>
<p>. Improved Literacy, Communication and Reading Skill
Students are known to get bored with writing and reading with books and paper. Social media gives
them access to information online which can be more catchy and interesting to read. It gives
students a different medium to learn which can help with making learning easier.</p>
